This is a utility for a simple XOR file encryption. The utility is written in
Java and can be launched as such:

java -jar crypted-resource-java-tool.jar [command] [params ...]

The allowed commands are:

- gen - Generate a new key for image encryption in base64 encoding. This command
        has only one parameter - the length of key in bytes.

        Example:
          java -jar crypted-resource-java-tool.jar gen 256
          # command generates 256 bytes = 2048 bits in base64 encoding

- xor - Outputs XOR of an input file and a key (base64) into the output file.
        Since XOR is a symmetric operation, this command is used for both
        encryption end decryption. Command has 3 parameters: input file, output
        file and key in base64 encoding.

        Example:
          java -jar crypted-resource-java-tool.jar in.bin out.bin p15xmz9k1MdqhlFgN1y95Q==
          # command takes bytes of in.bin, xors them (cyclically) with bits of
          # the key (decoded from base64) and outputs the bytes in out.bin

- help - Prints this help.
